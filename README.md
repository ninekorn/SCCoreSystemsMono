Ab3d OVR wrapper Monogame with jitter physics that i built myself. Something is not working anymore with the Content Pipeline for the original Jitter car.fbx so i am going to work on it soon. 

i dicked around a bit in trying to make a voxel planet and after a windows 10 computer reset, the car.fbx file isn't loading up correctly as a model. i will try and work on this soon.
